# 📈 Stock Trading Mentor  

An **AI-powered trading mentor** that helps beginners learn safe stock trading practices.  
By combining real market data with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, the system generates simple strategies, explains the reasoning behind them, and teaches users how to manage risk like a coach with “training wheels.”

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Most trading platforms overwhelm beginners with jargon and complex charts. **Stock Trading Mentor** bridges that gap by:  
- Generating **plain-language trading strategies**.  
- Backtesting ideas on historical data to check if they actually work.  
- Explaining concepts with analogies, charts, and Q&A.  
- Teaching risk management and portfolio diversification.  

**Our goal**: Make stock trading a learning experience, not just a guessing game.
